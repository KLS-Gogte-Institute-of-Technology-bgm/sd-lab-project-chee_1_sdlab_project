# Non-Functional Requirement
•	Safety Requirements
The database may get crashed at any certain time due to virus or operating 
system failure. Therefore it is required to take the database backup.
•	Security Requirements
We are going to develop a secured database for the university .There are 
different categories of users namely teaching staff, administrator, library 
staff ,students etc., Depending upon the category of user the access rights are 
decided. It means if the user is an administrator then he can be able to 
modify the data, delete, append etc., all other users other than library staff 
only have the rights to retrieve the information about database.
•	Software Quality Attributes
The Quality of the database is maintained in such a way so that it can be 
very user friendly to all the users of the database
•	Hardware Constraints
The system requires a database in order to store persistent data. The database 
should have backup capabilities.
•	Software Constraints
The development of the system will be constrained by the availability of 
required software such as database and development tools.
